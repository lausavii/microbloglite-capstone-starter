WELCOME TO TEAM TUNGSTEN!

Members: Laura, Guillermo, Luis, Sean, and Austin

Our website is called PluggedIn.

We created this website with a space theme to give the idea of users being pluggedin without any "escape".
I created the index page with a brief intro to our website, a section with our group members, and a footer with icons.

The nabvar has a link to our login page which I designed with Luis. You must insert a login and password to access the profile page from there. However, there are links to the registration page for users to sign up if they don't already have an account. The registration page was created and designed by Luis. The registration asks for username, password, fullname, and email address. There is a linkto redirect you to the sign up page once you register. Both the login and registration link have links to redirect the user to the home page.

The posts and profile were created by Guillermo and Austin. We have a few bugs in our code and could not produce the posts in our post page but it is full of html and css.

Sean created the javascript for all of the pages.

This project was very stressful because of having to work with a group so it was something different to what we were used to. However, I had a great time collaborating.
